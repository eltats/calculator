@node General information
@chapter General information

The calculator is developed in the C/C++ programming language using the ImGui and Implot.
The main principle of calculations is implemented on the basis of Dijkstra's algorithm, the essence of which is to convert mathematical expressions from infix notation to reverse Polish notation.

@node  Arithmetic operations
@chapter  Arithmetic operations

The following arithmetic operations are implemented in the calculator:
@enumerate
@item
Addition - a + b
@item
Subtraction - a - b
@item
Multiplication - a * b
@item
Division - a / b
@item
Power - a ^ b
@item
Remainder of the division - a mod b
@item
Unary plus - +a
@item
Unary minus - -a
@item
To enter complex expressions use left and right brackets - (a)
@end enumerate
You can specify a complex mathematical expression using the constant "x".
Enter the expression, click "=" and get the answer.

@node Math function
@chapter Math function

The following mathematical functions are implemented in the calculator:
@enumerate
@item
Computes cosine - cos(x)
@item
Computes sine - sin(x)
@item
Computes tangent - tan(x)
@item
Computes arc cosine - acos(x)
@item
Computes arc sine - asin(x)
@item
Computes arc tangent - atan(x)
@item
Computes square root - sqrt(x)
@item
Computes natural logarithm - ln(x)
@item
Computes common logarithm - log(x)
@end enumerate
Enter the expression, click "=" and get the answer.

@node Charts
@chapter Charts

The calculator implements the possibility of plotting functions.
In order to build a graph, it is necessary that the constant "x" is present in the expression.
Enter the expression, click the "=" button.
New window with a graph will appear.

@node Credit calculator
@chapter Credit calculator

The calculator has a special mode of operation: Credit Calculator.

The credit calculator window contains the following fields:

- Sum - the desired loan amount.
- Term - set in months, supports only integer values.
- Interest - the desired interest rate. Set as an integer or a floating-point number.
- The type of monthly payments is radiobutton, the type of calculation of monthly payments.

Output Fields: 
- Monthly loan payment
- Overpayment on the loan (interest)
- The total amount to be paid.

@node Deposit calculator
@chapter Deposit calculator

The calculator has a special mode of operation: Deposit Calculator.

The deposit calculator window contains the following fields:

- Sum - the initial deposit amount.
- Term - for how long you plan to invest money.
- The interest is the percentage at which you invest money.
- Tax - the current key rate of the Central Bank is set.
- Monthly or Yearly - the frequency of interest accrual 
- Capitalization - activate the checkbox if interest is credited to the account.
- Replenishments - the frequency of replenishment of the account.
- Withdraw - the frequency of partial withdrawals of the account.

Output fields:
- Accrued interest.
- The amount of tax.
- The amount of tax by the end of the deposit period.
